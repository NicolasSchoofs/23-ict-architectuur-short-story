*'Auteur: Nicolas'*

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a kind and wise king named Arden. He ruled his kingdom with compassion and fairness, and his people loved him dearly.

One day, a great dragon appeared in the kingdom, terrorizing the people and destroying their homes and crops. The people were afraid, and they begged the king for help.

King Arden knew that he had to do something to stop the dragon and save his people. He gathered his bravest knights and set out to face the dragon himself.

As they approached the dragon's lair, King Arden could feel his heart pounding in his chest. He knew that the dragon was powerful and dangerous, but he also knew that he had to be brave for his people.

With a great roar, the dragon appeared, spitting flames and smoke. King Arden and his knights charged forward, swords in hand, and engaged the dragon in a fierce battle.

For hours, they fought, but the dragon was too strong. Just as all seemed lost, King Arden remembered something that an old wizard had told him long ago. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and called upon the magic of the land.

Suddenly, a powerful gust of wind swept through the battlefield, lifting the dragon off the ground and carrying it far away. The people cheered, and King Arden was hailed as a hero.

From that day on, King Arden was known as the Dragon Slayer, and his bravery and wisdom were celebrated throughout the land. The dragon was never seen again, and the people lived in peace and prosperity for many years.

And so, the legend of King Arden and the Dragon lives on, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.
